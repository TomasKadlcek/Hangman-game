# Hangman
 
This project was made in the early days when I started programming. It is a mess :) but it works :D
 
Hangman makes use of the [RandomWords library](https://github.com/vaibhavsingh97/random-word/tree/master).

Other libraries used are tkinter for GUI and turtle for painting the HANGMAN...
